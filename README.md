# NBA-Model
This repo contains the code towards development of an NBA predictor model. Currently the repo contains python files 
that utilize the BeatifulSoup package and the Pandas package for scraping NBA data from the web and then 
processing and organizing that data into python Class structures and pandas DFs.
